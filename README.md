### Scenario:
	Heather, a marketing consultant in Los Angeles, is busy with balancing her work and family while she is practicing social distancing and working remotely from home. After first few weeks’ tension, Heather has not checked any updates on the spread of COVID19 for two weeks. These days, the weather gets warmer and Heather’s parents and daughters started to ask her if they could go out. Heather feels unsure and she realizes that she needs to learn more about the current spread of COVID19 before she could tell her family about the situation. 
	Heather first searches for COVID19 spread on Google but she could not find the cases map she wants. She taps on the cases map on CDC website with the hope to retrieve community information but it leads her to a general government health page. She then pulls out her phone and goes onto Facebook page, but she still could not find the information she wants. She then remembers that she has the app and opens the app. She clicks on the map tap in the app and uses two fingers to zoom in and out. She clicks on filter taps to view only “active cases” and “death cases” in her community. She then quickly clicks on the visualization tap and stares at the page for a few seconds. She scrolls up and down and clicks on filter taps of “tested cases” and “active cases” on the timeline visualization. She glances through the graphs and frowns for a few seconds. She starts to decide how to tell or show her family members about the current situation during lunch.
