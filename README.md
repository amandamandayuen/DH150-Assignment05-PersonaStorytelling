## Persona 1: Heather Walker

### Scenario:
Heather, a marketing consultant in Los Angeles, is busy with balancing her work and family while she is practicing social distancing and working remotely from home. After first few weeks’ tension, Heather has not checked any updates on the spread of COVID19 for two weeks. These days, the weather gets warmer and Heather’s parents and daughters started to ask her if they could go out. Heather feels unsure and she realizes that she needs to learn more about the current spread of COVID19 before she could tell her family about the situation. 

Use Case: Heather first searches for COVID19 spread on Google but she could not find the cases map she wants. She taps on the cases map on CDC website with the hope to retrieve community information but it leads her to a general government health page. She then pulls out her phone and goes onto Facebook page, but she still could not find the information she wants. She then remembers that she has the app and opens the app. She clicks on the map tap in the app and uses two fingers to zoom in and out. She clicks on filter taps to view only “active cases” and “death cases” in her community. She then quickly clicks on the visualization tap and stares at the page for a few seconds. She scrolls up and down and clicks on filter taps of “tested cases” and “active cases” on the timeline visualization. She glances through the graphs and frowns for a few seconds. She starts to decide how to tell or show her family members about the current situation during lunch. 

## Persona 2: Madison Yong

### Scenario:
Madison has a tough day again as she could not fall into sleep and stays up to the morning. This condition has persisted for around two weeks and she thinks she might need some help. She feels so stress when she is thinking about the things she needs to manage, such as her schoolwork, food and supplies, her own health condition, and also her future. She has been overwhelmed by her situation for so long, but she does not tell her parents as she does not want to worry them. Madison decides to take a step forward to seek for mental health help online but she does not know where to start and what to do, and she’s already on several COVID19 websites.

Use Case: After a sleepless night, she lies on her bed and pulls out her phone. Madison typically uses the app to monitor and track COVID-19 data, but this time she opens the app and goes onto the “resources” page. She taps on the “Q&A” tap and sees many users posting different types of questions regarding their conditions. She finds many posts about mental health questions similar to hers. Under the Q&A page, she finds a help tap that prompts her to submit her own questions. She hesitates and thengo back to “resources” page and types in “mental health” in search bar. She finds a section of professional mental health resources with phone number and email address provided. She glances through the description of each one and decides to make a phone call to one of the resources.
	


## Persona 3: Finn Andino

### Scenario:
Finn is sitting inside his restaurant. It’s after lunch time and he just finished a round of busy food handling and restaurant disinfecting. He feels tired. Even though he has transformed his restaurant online and has joined several food delivery apps, he is still getting used to the transformation with digital technologies. He is much more familiar with his phone but he still finds it hard to use a computer. He tries to do more with his phone, including getting updates of public health announcements on restaurant operations as well as testing booths information. 

Use Case: Finn’s kids recommended the app to him, but he has not tried it before. He downloaded the app from app store and opens it up carefully. He taps onto different taps including “map” and “visualization”, and he murmured that the fonts and graphs are too small for him to see. He then remembers he should look for testing booths and government announcements information, but he goes back and forth on different taps for a few minutes. He finally taps onto the “government updates” taps, and scrolls up and down to check for announcement relevant to restaurants. He sees the “food facilities” section and taps into it slowly. He reads out the notices loud and then carefully taps back to “government updates” page and scrolls up and down for “testing booth” section. He finally taps into the section, stares at the information for a while, and pulls out pen and paper to write down the information. He then makes a call to one of his kids to seek for confirmation.
